1. Why do you think programmers shouldn't under-comment / over-comment in their code?

  Under-commenting would not provide enough context to help other programmers understand what the programmer is doing. Over-commenting could result in the program not being readable and leads to redundancy. Using common sense (like self-documenting code) should lead to a reasonable balance of comments.

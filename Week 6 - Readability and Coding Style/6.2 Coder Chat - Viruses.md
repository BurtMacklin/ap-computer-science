> "Strange as it may sound, the computer virus is something of an Information Age marvel. On one hand, viruses show us how vulnerable we are -- a properly engineered virus can have a devastating effect, disrupting productivity and doing billions of dollars in damages. On the other hand, they show us how sophisticated and interconnected human beings have become."

Crime has existed since the beginning of human society. People would steal fruit from others when no one is watching, and in most cases would go unnoticed. Since then, society has evolved with law enforcement and constant monitoring (NSA, security cameras, etc.) I would have to say that virus is the equivalent to digital crime - and it is indeed a marvel unique to our generation since technology didn't exist back then. Both cyberciminals and law enforcement agencies have gotten smarter as more sophisticated viruses are built every day.

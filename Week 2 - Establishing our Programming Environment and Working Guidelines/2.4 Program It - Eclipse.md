# Running Eclipse from a Flash Drive

My school is pretty restrictive when it comes to software (and I don't want to wait for a few weeks for my school to install Eclipse), so I used the Portable version that has JDK tools included and uses the native JRE built into Windows.

It's actually quite nice since you can put Eclipse on your flash drive and run it from any computer. Your settings are saved to a folder instead of your user account.

Here's what my Luna looks like, with Eclipse Color Theme, Moonrise UI, Sublime Keybindings, and More Clipboard:

I also wasn't able to create C:/!!VHSJava or C:/!!JavaDownload because of security restrictions (and I don't feel like this is a good idea for shared computers,) so I created these folders on my desktop instead. The paths don't make a difference in Eclipse as long as the workspace file structure is still intact.

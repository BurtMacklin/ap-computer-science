# Victor's Java Questions

I started writing my paragraphs, but then I realized that everyone else has covered the exact same points. I'll try my best mix it up a little - tell me what you think. :)

## What is the importance of Java:

Java is the most common programming language in the world, powering a wide range of tools from Android smartphones to the New York Stock Exchange. People love Java because it allows programmers to write code for every platform without having to recompile for every separate platform, and as a result this serves as an incentive for hardware makers  to make their devices Java-compatible.

Java is an object-oriented language, meaning that a major selling point for programmers is the ability to reuse code without rewriting code, saving lots of valuable time.

## What is an IDE?

An Integrated Development Environment is a developer stack that consists of a text editor and all the tools required to develop for a specific platform.

Eclipse, IntelliJ, and Xcode are three of the most common desktop IDEs.

Ordinary text editors such as Notepad++ and Sublime Text can also be extended to functions IDE if properly configured (I use Sublime Text as my IDE for web development with a built-in code compiler and server.

## The JVM:

The Java Virtual Machine runs Java code AFTER it has been compiled.

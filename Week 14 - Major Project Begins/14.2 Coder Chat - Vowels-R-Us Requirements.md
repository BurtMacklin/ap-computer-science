# Vowels-R-Us Requirements

- Since this is a major project, and it might be intimidating at first, you might want to share thoughts that can help the whole class community start off on the right foot.
- Write your thoughts about the steps you'll need to take in order to develop this program.
- Provide just a general idea of what you would do to develop the code. You do not need to explain what variables or methods you will incorporate in your program. This information should remain private.

I would read over the rubric and create a program that would score the highest marks in each program.

The assignment has has specific conditions that need to be met and I would probably determine while a if or while loop is appropriate for each condition. From there, I would preform the exact action stated on the paper and test constantly.

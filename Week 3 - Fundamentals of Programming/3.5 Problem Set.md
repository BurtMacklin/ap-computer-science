# Exercise 1.4 (3.5 Problem Set)

1. State two of the difficulties of programming with machine language.

	Machine language uses binary notation, which leads to many problems. Coding in machine language is a slow, time-consuming process, and it’s nearly impossible for humans to interpret each other’s programs.

2. State two features of assembly language.

	Assembly language is more human-friendly machine language, mainly because of its use of mnemonics to represent instructions and data.

	Assembly language corresponds directly to a single set of instructions in machine language and therefore can be translated into machine language by an assembler.

3. What is a loader, and what is it used for?

	A loader loads and runs machine language programs. It’s used for running binary.

4. State one difference between a high-level language and assembly language.

	High-level languages corresponds to many instructions in machine language instead of a single instruction in assembly language.

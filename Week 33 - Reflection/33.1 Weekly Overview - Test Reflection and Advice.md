**Did you feel prepared?**

I felt very prepared for the AP Computer Science exam after studying from a Barron’s prep book since their practice problems were significantly harder than the test.

**How did the content on the exam compared to the content we covered in class?**

The exam was fair game to the content that was covered in class. I wished we spent more time working with writing classes from scratch using instance variables, constructors, and basic methods, and using these classes in our programs.

**Now that you have taken the exam, do you feel that you have any more suggestions for me for next year's students?**

Pratice, paratice, pratice! You’ll only get better the more you program. Don’t be afraid to try new languages outside of class, like  Python or Ruby - they’re not as scary as Java. :wink:

**Which APCS Program It activity posed the biggest challenge for you? Why?**

The Elevens labs proved to be very challenging because it proved to be time consuming and mostly a matter of trial and error.

**How might you change the program to improve its performance?**

I would completely rewrite how the Deck works into a simpler, easier to manage list.

**Select a favorite Program It activity from this year. Why was it a favorite? Imagine yourself as a programmer. Your supervisor will give you a bonus in your paycheck if you add new functionality to your favorite program. How will you choose to modify it?**

I would modify Magpie to act more like Jarvis (from Iron Man) by having it communicate from the internet.

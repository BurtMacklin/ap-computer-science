# Exercise 1.3 (2.5 Problem Set)

1. Translate 111000112 to a base 10 number.

	(1 * 2^7) +  (1 * 2^6) +  (1 * 2^5) + (0 * 2^4) + (0 * 2^3) + (0 * 2^2) + (1 * 2^1) + (1 * 2^0) = **227**

2. Translate 45B16 to a base 10 number.

	(4 * 16^2) + (5 * 16^1) + 11 = **1115**

3. What is the difference between Unicode and ASCII?

	The American Standard for Information Interchange is limited to 128 characters because it was limited to 8 bits or 1 byte. Unicode allows for a wider range of characters because it has a larger bit limit.

4. Assume that 4 bits are used to represent the intensities of red, green, and blue. How many total colors are possible in this scheme?

	(2^4)^3 = **4096 colors**

5. An old â€“ fashioned computer has just 16 bits available to represent an address of a memory location. How many total memory locations can be addressed in this machine?

	An old - fashioned computer with 16 bits available to represent an address of a memory location has 2 total memory locations because each memory location requires 8 bits or 1 byte. 16/8 = **2**

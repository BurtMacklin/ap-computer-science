## Fundamentals of Java, Page 279, Review Questions 1-8

Write a brief answer to each of the following questions.
  
1. List the three logical operators.

  1. && AND
  2. || OR
  3. ! NOT

2. Construct a truth table for the expression ```P OR NOT Q```.

  | P     | Q     | P OR NOT Q |
  |-------|-------|------------|
  | true  | true  | true       |
  | true  | false | true       |
  | false | true  | false      |
  | false | false | true       |


3. Suppose P is true and Q is false. What is the value of the expression ```P AND NOT Q```?

  True.
  
  | P     | Q     | P AND NOT Q |
  |-------|-------|-------------|
  | true  | true  | false       |
  | true  | false | **true**    |
  | false | true  | false       |
  | false | false | false       |

4. Write an ```if``` statement that displays whether or not a given number is between a lower bound ```min``` and an upper bound ```max```, inclusive. Use a logical operator in the condition.

  ```java
  if (x>min && x<max) {
    // x is greater than min and less than max
  }
  ```

5. Rewrite the ```if``` statement in Question 4 to use a nested ```if``` statement

  ```java
  if (x>min) {
    // x is greater than min
    if (x<max) {
      // x is less than max
    }
  }
  ```

6. Write a nested loop that displays a 10-by-10 square of asterisks.

  ```java
  for (int i = 0; i<10; i++) {
    for (int e = 0; e<10; e++) {
      System.out.print("*");
    }
    System.out.println();
  }
  ```

7. Give an example of an assertion and show how it can be checked with Javaâ€™s ```assert``` statement.

  x must 1 after a set of operations for the program to continue.
  
  ```
  assert x = 1;
  ```
  
8. Explain the role that variant and invariant assertions play in showing that a loop is correct.

  It allows you verify the correctness of a loop by showing relationships between variables and operations.

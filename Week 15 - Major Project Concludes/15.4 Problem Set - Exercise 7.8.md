## Fundamentals of Java, Page 270, Exercise 7.8 Continued

Write code segments that perform the following tasks:

1. Replace every blank space character in the string ```str``` with a newline character ('\n').

  ```java
  str.replace(" ", "\n");
  ```

2. Find the index of the first instance of the substring ```the``` in the string ```str```.

  ```java
  str.indexOf("the");
  ```
  
3. Find the index of the first instance of the substring ```the``` after the midpoint of the string ```str```.

  ```java
  str.indexOf("the", str.length()/2);
  ```

4. Count the number of instances of the whole word "the" in the string ```str```.

  ```java
  while (position != -1) {
    position++;
    position = str.indexOf("the", position);
    instances++;
  }
  ```

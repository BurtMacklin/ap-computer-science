# 9.5 Problem Set - Exercise 4.7

1. Describe in English what the following code segments do:

	```java
	// i is an integer that starts at 1.
	// When i is less than or equal to a specified limit then add 1 to i and run the for loop
	for (int i = 1; i <= limit; i++) {
		// If i divided by 2 has no remainder (also known as modulo) then the if loop is run
		// In other words, i must be an even number
		if (i % 2 == 0) {
			// The result gets printed.
			System.out.println(i);
		}
	}
	```
	
	```java
	// Calls random method
	Random gen = new Random();
	// Sets myNumber to a random integer between 0-9
	// Then adds 1 to the value so the range becomes 1-10
	int myNumber = gen.nextInt(10) + 1;
	// Sets x to 0
	int x = 0;
	// Creates integer variable yourNumber (actual number)
	int yourNumber;
	// Loop for while x equals zero
	while (x == 0){
		// Prints two lines of strings
		System.out.println("I'm guessing a number between 1 and 10.");
		System.out.print("Which number is it? ");
		// Asks for an integer input (number guessed)
		yourNumber = reader.nextInt();
		// If number guessed matches the actual number
		if (myNumber == yourNumber){
			// Prints a string informing a user about success
			System.out.println("That's it!");
			// Ends program
			break;
		}
		// Print a string telling a user to try again and restarts loop
		else System.out.println("Sorry, try again");
	}
	```
	
2. Write code segments that use loops to perform the following tasks:

	a. Print the squares and cubes of the first 10 positive, odd integers. (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19)

		```java
		for (int i = 0; i <= 20; i++) {
			if (i % 2 != 0) {
				System.out.println(i + " squared is " + Math.pow(i, 2) + " and cubed is " + Math.pow(i, 3));
			}
		}
		```
		Output:

		```output
		1 squared is 1.0 and cubed is 1.0
		3 squared is 9.0 and cubed is 27.0
		5 squared is 25.0 and cubed is 125.0
		7 squared is 49.0 and cubed is 343.0
		9 squared is 81.0 and cubed is 729.0
		11 squared is 121.0 and cubed is 1331.0
		13 squared is 169.0 and cubed is 2197.0
		15 squared is 225.0 and cubed is 3375.0
		17 squared is 289.0 and cubed is 4913.0
		19 squared is 361.0 and cubed is 6859.0
		```

	b. Build a string consisting of the first 10 positive, even digits in descending order. (20, 18, 16, 14, 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2, 0)

		```java
			String FirstTenEvenDigits = "";
			StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();

			for (int i = 20; i >= 0; i--) {
				if (i % 2 == 0) {
						sb.append(i);
						sb.append(" ");
						FirstTenEvenDigits = sb.toString();
				}
			}
			
		System.out.println(FirstTenEvenDigits);	    	
		```

		Output: 

		```output
		20 18 16 14 12 10 8 6 4 2 0 
		```

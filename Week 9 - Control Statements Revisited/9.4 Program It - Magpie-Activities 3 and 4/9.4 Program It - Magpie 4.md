# Magpie 4

Read and complete all of the Prepare and Exploration sections of the Student Guide before completing your work below. Read completely through the Exercises as well. You will reference and change the text of Magpie4 (reprinted below) in these remaining Lab activities.

## Exploration

I want to build a robot.  
> What would it mean to build a robot?

I want to understand French.
> What would it mean to understand French?

Do you like me?
> What makes you think that I like you?

You confuse me.
> What makes you think I confuse you?

## Alter the code

- Would you really be happy if you had *something*?

- Why do you *something* me?

## Investigate

Find an example of when this structure does not work well. How can you improve it?

- I  want you to make me sandwich
  - **Problem**:  It responds with "Would you really be happy if you had you to make me a sandwich?", which makes no sense.
  - **Solution**: I would create a reponse for "I want you to" and place it before "I want" in the response loop.

- Have you and I met before?
  - **Problem**: The program has nothing in its code to understand a phrase where "you" is used before "I". The program solely understands statements that are "I" before "you". 
  - **Solution**: You could create a different response for when you is placed before I, one where it recognizes that you is placed before I. This allows for something that makes more sense to be used compared to just a random response.

Read and complete all of the Prepare and Exploration sections of the Student Guide before completing your work below. Read completely through the Exercise and Question as well. You will reference and change the text of Magpie3 (reprinted below) in these remaining Lab activities.

## Exploration: Using the API

Add the following extensions to the StringExplorer main method:

Comment | Java code | Output
-- | -- | --
indexOf when the substring does not occur 1 | ```int notFoundPsn = sample.indexOf ("slow"); System.out.println ("sample.indexOf(\"slow\") = " + notFoundPsn);``` | 0
 indexOf "he" starting at position 0 | ```int notFoundPsn = sample.indexOf("he"); System.out.println("sample.indexOf(\"he\") = " + notFoundPsn);``` | 1
indexOf "he" starting at position 10  | ```int notFoundPsn = sample.indexOf("he"); System.out.println("sample.indexOf(\"he\") = " + notFoundPsn);``` | 33
indexOf "he" starting at position 35  | ```int notFoundPsn = sample.indexOf("he", 35);``` | -1

## Exploration: Understand the New Method

 Call | Code | Iteration | psn | before | after
-- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- 
1 | ```findKeyword("She's my sister", "sister", 0);```  | 1 | 9 | " "  
 | | | | 2      
 | | | | 3      
2 | ```findKeyword("Brother Tom is helpful", "brother", 0);``` | 1 | 0 | | " "
 | | | 2 | -1     
 | | | 3 | -1     
3 | ```findKeyword("I can't catch wild cats.", "cat", 0);``` | 1 | 9 | " " | "c"
 | | | 2  | 20 | " " | "s" 
 | | | 3      
4 | ```findKeyword("I know nothing about snow plows.", "no", 0);``` | 1 | 3 | "k" | "w"
 | | | 2 | 7 | " " | "t"
 | | | 3 | 22 | "s" | "w"

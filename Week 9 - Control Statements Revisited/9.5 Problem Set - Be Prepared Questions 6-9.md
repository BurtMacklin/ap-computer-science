# 9.5 Problem Set - Be Prepared Questions 6-9

> Note: The textbook's DRM prevents me from copying the questions or copying the code to verify my math using Eclipse, so only my attempted and correct answers are included below.

## Question 6

**My answer:** I and II works, so it's C 

**Correct answer:** C

## Question 7

**My answer:** I chose E because both return the same results when I plugged in 1, 36, and 100. 

**Correct answer:** E

## Question 8

**My answer:** I chose D because I tested in terms of [x,y] where x > y: [1,0] [2,0] [2,1] and there can be no more than 3 outputs. 

**Correct answer:** D

## Question 9

**My answer:** Eliminated to E or D.  A & C excludes 2 instead of meeting the precondition. A & B decrements before the method is called and won't reached 101. E seems to only seems to be run IF the increment is prime, so I went with D. 

**Correct answer:** D

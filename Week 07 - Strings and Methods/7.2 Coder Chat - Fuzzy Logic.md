# 7.2 Coder Chat - Fuzzy Logic

## Instructions

1. http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/fuzzy-logic

2. What do you think about all the technological devices and home appliances that claim to use Fuzzy Logic?

3. Do you have similar opinions, or very different opinions, from your classmates?

4. What student posts and ideas surprised you? Why?

## My Response

My friend built a machine learning program a few months ago that allows a user to train a machine to recognize red.

Using bolean values in this case could be a problem if a machine is not fully trained (it would take around hundreds of thouands of inputs with this program to even reach 99.9%) so we used fuzzy logic instead.

Here are a screenshots of this project in action and where fuzzy logic comes into pratical use:

## J's Response

This is actually wicked cool and really clears up the misconceptions I had about fuzzy logic. Thanks for the example!

## E's Response

Wow! That is amazing, as well as it is a very good example of how fuzzy logic can be used in technology. Using the machine that you used you made the machine able to recognize how red something is. This is a great example, as colors come in many different shades.

This is pretty similar to a program I wrote last year in school. Our class has 15 scribbler robots, and we each had our own with a unique avatar (carved styrofoam that we painted) that was put on the robots. We had to develop a program that allowed the robots to move around the room without crashing, all while taking pictures to try and detect other robots based on the avatars, and respond with a unique action accordingly. I ended up creating the algorithm for the image processing. It was based partly off of Root Mean Square (RMS), as we had stored images of each robot into a database to be queried. 

These kind of programs can be difficult to make, and defiantly demonstrate the usefulness of fuzzy logic. The program you wrote to detect the color red is very interesting, and I like the way you output the data back to the user; it is very clean.

very cool ! This hyperlink was confusing and now this all makes sense !

## S's Response

Wow I think this is extremely cool and a perfect example. I was a little confused at first as to the uses of Fuzzy Logic but this really cleared it up for me!

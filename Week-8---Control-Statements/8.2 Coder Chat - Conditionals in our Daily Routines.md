## Describe a natural task that you do everyday - using a computerized form.

Here's my daily routine in a computerized form:

    fetch day of week;
    fetch school calendar;
    fetch side projects;

    if (today is a school day according to school calender) {

        wake up;
        eat breakfast;
        leave at bus time;
        go to school;

        fetch extra extracurricular activities;

        foreach (extracurricular activity in extracurricular activities) {
            do extracurricular activity;

            if (extracurricular activity is robotics or meetup) {
                fetch train schedules;
                take train;
            }
        }

        go home;

        if (tired and greater than 3 hours before sleep) {
            take nap OR drink coffee;
        } endif;

        fetch homework and homework priorities;
        fetch side projects;

        foreach (short term homework in homework) {
            do short term homework;
        }

        if (day of week is tuesday) {
            do submit vhs assignments;
        }

        eat dinner;

        foreach (side project in side projects) {
            do side project;
        }

        foreach (long term homework in homework) {
            do long term homework;
        }

        do set alarm;
        go to sleep early;

    }

    if (today is NOT a school day and tomorrow is a school day according to school calender) {
        
        wake up;
        do anything;
        do set alarm;
        go to sleep early;

    }

    else {
        
        wake up;
        do anything;
        go to sleep;

    }

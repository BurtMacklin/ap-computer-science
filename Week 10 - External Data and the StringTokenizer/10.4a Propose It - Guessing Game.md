# Project 7-1

## Problem

In a game of guessing numbers, one person says, I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.¬ù The other person guesses 50. The first person replies, No, the number is less. The second person then guesses 25, and so on, until she guesses correctly. Write a program that plays this game. The computer knows the number (a random number between 1 and 100) and the user is the guesser. At the end of the game, the computer displays the number of guesses required by the user to guess the number correctly.

## Solution

- Create integer variable *ActualNumber*, set to 0
- While variable *ActualNumber* is less than 1 or greater than 100
     - Print "I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100."
	 - Asks for an integer input
	 - Store the input as *ActualNumber*
	 - (This loop serves as validation)
- Create integer variable *GussedNumber*, set to 0
- Create integer variable *NumberOfGuesses*, set to 0
- While *GuessedNumber* does not equal *ActualNumber*
 	- Asks for an integer input
	- Store the input as *ActualNumber*
  	- If *GuessedNumber* is less than 1 or greater than 100
	  	- Print "Pick another number between 1 and 100."
	- If *GuessedNumber* is higher than *ActualNumber*
		- Print "No, the number is less."
		- Add one to *NumberOfGuesses*
	- Else *GuessedNumber* is less than *ActualNumber*
		- Print "No, the number is more."
		- Add one to *NumberOfGuesses*
- Then *GuessedNumber* MUST equal *ActualNumber*
	- Print "You finally found it!"
	- Print "If only took you *NumberOfGuesses* guesses!"

## Problem

Rewrite the program of Project 7-1 so that the user knows the number and the computer must guess it.

## Solution

- Create integer variable *ActualNumber*, set to a random number between 0 to 100
- Create integer variable *GussedNumber*, set to 0
- Create integer variable *NumberOfGuesses*, set to 0
- While *GuessedNumber* does not equal *ActualNumber*
 	- Asks for an integer input
	- Store the input as *ActualNumber*
  	- If *GuessedNumber* is less than 1 or greater than 100
	  	- Print "Pick another number between 1 and 100."
	- If *GuessedNumber* is higher than *ActualNumber*
		- Print "No, the number is less."
		- Add one to *NumberOfGuesses*
	- Else *GuessedNumber* is less than *ActualNumber*
		- Print "No, the number is more."
		- Add one to *NumberOfGuesses*
- Then *GuessedNumber* MUST equal *ActualNumber*
	- Print "You finally found it!"
	- Print "If only took you *NumberOfGuesses* guesses!"

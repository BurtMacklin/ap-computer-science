# StringTokenizer vs Split

- What is your opinion about using the StringTokenizer instead of the
   method split() of the String Class?  Look at the Java Doc API for more.
- What methods of the StringTokenizer
   class you do not understand, either because of the parameters or the
   returned values?
- How does the StringTokenizer help in the
   manipulation of text files?

I view StringTokenizer as an extension of the split method, where it splits spaces into an array of variables. It can make extracting a specific set of words or characters much easier.

At first, the documentation provided so much information that it was hard to differentiate between the important information and the not-so-important information but after looking at the code samples, I had a good grasp on StringTokenizer. I was surprised to find out that StringTokenizer has been classified as a legacy class because I can find many use cases for for this method.

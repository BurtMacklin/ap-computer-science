## My Response

One use case for the random class is in a chart-topping virtual reality game called Minecraft.

It uses the random class to generate every aspect of the game - from the environment to random creature spawning and it's really amazing.

Hey Victor!

I used to play to play minecraft a lot last year. I really enjoyed how the game is randomly generated! It made creative mode seeds really fun!

I never would have thought to mention Minecraft, but now that you mention it that is the perfect example for something that is randomly generated!

Yes! Minecraft! The randomness is one of the greatest aspects of the game; your world and nothing in it is completely predictable.

## A few complete sentences in the Comments area that describe the difference between your version of the project and your classmate's version:

I looked over Tina's project because she had difficulty running it from eclipse, and her programs ran just fine! I took the time to verify her output using Google as well.

One of the differences I've noticed was that my project had all the code in a single, well-documented, file. Based on the feedback I've received from my classmates, my program runs just fine as it is, but I have revised it to fix a few typos in my comments.

Tina, on the other hand, had separate project files containing only the code necessary to run the program. Sometimes, simple is often better.

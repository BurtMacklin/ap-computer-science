# My Quiz Strategy

The quizzes the past few weeks have been very tough and rigorous (and I have to admit, I was struggling with them!)

I generally have out a calculator, pencil, and paper with most of my classes memorized. Most of these questions require a bit of thinking, and there's generally not enough time to plug every single solution into a computer so I quickly try to see which answers make sense (especially criteria) then plug them in. I try to eliminate down to as two answers if possible, which gives me a 50/50 chance that it's correct. Then I go with my gut instinct, and things would usually work toward my favor.

The more challenging problems are the ones that require more arithmetic (like Question 1) because it takes a little longer and you really can only plug things in and see if they work. I eliminate answers and pace myself by limiting each question to 2 minutes, then come back later.

I scored a 100% on my last quiz, so there aren't any corrections I have to make, but I will revise my quizzes from the previous week.

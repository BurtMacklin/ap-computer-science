## 7.4c Revise It (6.5 Problem Set Reflection)

1. Which question did you answer most easily and most correctly? Why?

  Giving examples of different literals was pretty easy since it's a no-brainer question. These type of things come into my head right away and it took me no more than a few seconds to come up with a valid name for an integer literal, a floating-point literal, and a string literal.

2. What was the most challenging question of the problem set? Why?
  
  I would have to say that finding the batting average of the baseball player was the most challenging mainly because I didn't know how the basics of baseball and that lack of background information led me to develop a completely differnet set of psuedocode.

3. After comparing your work to the answer key, what do you think you need to revisit in this chapter?
  
  I would like to have more practice writing psuedocode!

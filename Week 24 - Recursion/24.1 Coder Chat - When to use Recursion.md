# When to use Recursion

We do understand that a recursive method is one that calls itself over and over again. In the larger picture, recursion is an elegant way to solve some very complex computing problems.

If you want to use computing power to find the Fibonacci sequence, identify a factorial, or perform a summation function, you might want to use recursion.

Recursion isn't the right tool in every situation, though. It can use much more computer memory than an iterative sequence. In this week's discussion, you will share your thoughts about the pros and cons of recursion and the situations where it represents the best tool for the job.

When should you use recursion? Can you form any general rules or guidelines that would help you make this choice?

Is it worth it? Think both as a programmer and a client.

# Exercise 13.1

1. What keeps a recursive definition from being circular?

  A specific output will be predefined to prevent infinite iterations.

2. What are the two parts of any recursive method?

  Precondition and the recursion itself.

3. Why is recursion more expensive than iteration?

  It takes longer than incrementing and a method call ties up more memory until it completes its task.

4. What are the benefits of using recursion?

  In certain causes it provides the easiest way to program.

5. Consider the following definition of the method raise,  which raises a given number to a given  exponent. Draw a trace of the complete execution of raise(2, 5).

  ```
    Base: 2; Exponent: 5; Sum: 32
    Base: 2; Exponent: 4; Sum: 16
    Base: 2; Exponent: 3; Sum: 8
    Base: 2; Exponent: 2; Sum: 4
    Base: 2; Exponent: 1; Sum: 2
  ```

6. Consider the following method. What happens during the execution of whatAMethod(3)?

  StackOverflow Exception. You are not modifying the parameter n in any way and the program will recurse infinitely.

# Using the Assert Statement for Debugging

- Now that the concept of assertions is clear, think about the possibilities of using this in the debugging phase of your coding.
- We know by experience that a recently-built program is rarely free of errors. How can this new tool help us in the development of our programs?
- How do you see this helping in your coding practice?

## My Response

I find assertions to be pretty useful when it comes to debugging (so that I don't have to constantly log my outputs or write multiple while loops.)

It's also great for validating input/outputs in development.

I agree that they are useful for verifying inputs in development.  Whenever I just want to write a function but make it semi-robust, an assert is a super-easy way to check your conditions without creating your own exception classes, generating messages, etc.

You summed everything up basically and stated the truth, which is that assertions are useful when it comes to debugging. I'd also like to emphasize that assertions are placed in code to prevent hardware from getting ruined, as assertions may shut down code that could be overheating, or starts to ruin hardware when it is getting overworked.

With debugging, what's the big deal with using some special thingamabob rather than just checking your logic?

## Fundamentals of Java, Exercise 7.7

1. 1 and 2: Write appropriate input assertions and output assertions for each of the following loops. Write appropriate loop invariant and loop variant assertions for each of the loops.

  a.
  ```java
  score = reader.nextInt();
  while (score != -999){
    numScores = numScores + 1;
    sum = sum + score;
    System.out.print(“Enter a score; -999 to quit: “);
    score = reader.nextInt();
  }
  ```
  ```java
  // Output Assertion
  assert score != -999;
  ```
  ```java
  // Input Assertion
  assert sum >= score;
  ```
  **Invariant Assertion:**
  
  At each and every interval, ```numScores``` increases by 1, sum increases by score, and an ```input``` asks for a score.
  
  **Variant Assertion:**
  
  During the duration of the execution, ```numScores``` is the amount of times the while loop has been run, and ```sum``` is the sum of all ```sum``` values entered in previous intervals.
  
  b.
  ```java
  count = 0;
  power2 = 1;
  while (power2 < 100){
    System.out.println(power2);
    power2 = power2 * 2;
    count = count + 1;
  }
  ```
  ```java
  // Output Assertion
  assert power2 == 1 && count == 0;
  ```
  ```java
  // Input Assertion
  assert power2 == Math.pow(2, count);
  ```
  **Invariant Assertion:**
  
  At each and every interval, ```power2``` is doubled, and ```count``` is increased by 1.
  
  **Variant Assertion:**
  
  During the duration of the execution, ```count``` resperesents the number of times the while loop has been run, and ```power2``` equals 2^count.

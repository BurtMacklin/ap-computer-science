# 9.2 Coder Chat: Using While or For?

 - In what situation you would use *while* instead of *for*?
 - How can logical  operators help with the complexity of the decision? How is the use of  logical operators like nested control statements?
 - Do you have similar opinions, or very different opinions, from your classmates?
 - What student posts and ideas surprised you? Why?

I find both the *while* and *for* loops to be very similar, and it really comes down to personal preference.

I prefer to use *while* loops when there is a condition that needs to be met and I don't know how many times the loop needs to be run, and *for* loops when I know how many times I need to loop through a set of functions.

Logical operators bring a sense of logic to computers and makes programs easier to create. It also helps with efficency by repeating tasks without having to rewrite the same code a bunch of times.
